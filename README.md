# Double Pendulum Simulation Using PINN

A Physics-Informed Neural Networks (**PINN**) created to predict the chaotic motion of a double pendulum. 

The result is compared with solutions calculated using the **odeint** function from SciPy.

# Features

* **Physics-based Data Generation:** SciPy's odeint function generates trajectories for various initial conditions.
* **PINN Model:** PINN incorporates the Euler-Lagrange equations directly into the loss function.
* **Chaotic Motion Prediction:** The trained model aims to accurately predict the highly non-linear and chaotic trajectories.
* **Visual Analytic Tools:** Plots and animations to compare model predictions against the ground-truth trajectories.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Allows experimentation with initial conditions and PINN properties.
