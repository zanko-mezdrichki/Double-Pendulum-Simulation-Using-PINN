# 🤖 Double Pendulum Simulation Using PINN

A machine-learning model, built with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), to predict the chaotic motion of a double pendulum.

## ✨ Features

* **Physics-based Data Generation:** SciPy's odeint function generates ground-truth time-series trajectories for various initial conditions.
* **PINN Model:** The neural network incorporates physics constraints directly into the loss function, using the system's governing differential equations.
* **Chaotic Motion Prediction:** The trained model aims to accurately predict the highly non-linear and chaotic trajectories.
* **Visual Analytic Tools:** Plots and animations to compare model predictions against the ground-truth trajectories for in-depth evaluation.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Allows experimentation with initial conditions and PINN properties.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/zanko-mezdrichki/Double-Pendulum-Simulation-Using-PINN.git](https://github.com/zanko-mezdrichki/Double-Pendulum-Simulation-Using-PINN.git)
    cd Double-Pendulum-Simulation-Using-PINN
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install simpy numpy matplotlib pytorch scipy
    ```
    *(Note: A GPU is highly recommended for faster training)*

3.  **Start the program:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  Enter the configuration values when prompted.

## ⚙️ Parameters & Configuration

On startup, `main.py` will prompt you to configure the simulation and model. This is key for experimenting with the system's chaotic nature.

- **Initial Conditions:** $\theta_1$, $\dot{\theta}_1$, $\theta_2$, $\dot{\theta}_2$
- **Physical Properties:** $m_1$, $m_2$, $L_1$, $L_2$, $g$
- **Model Hyperparameters:** Time of the simmulation, number of time points considered, learning rate, epochs.

## 🕹️ Preview

For more details and results, see double_pendulum.pdf(highly recommended).

In the preview folder there are images showing the training history and the comparison between angles calculated with the two methods with default parameters.
